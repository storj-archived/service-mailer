var mailer = new StorjMailer({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  auth: {

});

mailer.dispatch('<to_email_address>', '<template_name>', {
  template: 'variables',
  go: { in: 'here' }
}, function(err) {

});
```

Templates
---------

To add a new email template to this package, see the `templates/` directory.
Choose a new name for the template and create 3 files:

* `templatename.subject` - Contains plain text subject text (hbs supported)
* `templatename.txt` - Contains plain text email body (hbs supported)
* `templatename.html` - Contains HTML formatted email body (hbs supported)

Once these files are added to the templates directory, you can reference them 
by `templatename` when calling `Mailer#dispatch`.
